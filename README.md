# LCD TCP Display Driver for LCD Smartie (v1.0.0.2b)

This is a high-performance, multithreaded Windows DLL designed as a display plugin for **LCD Smartie**. It allows the software to communicate with remote LCD displays over a network (WiFi/Ethernet) via the TCP protocol.

### Credits

This project is a heavily enhanced fork of the original work by **eeyrw** ([GitHub Profile](https://github.com/eeyrw)). This version has been modernized to support expanded hardware features and improved network stability.

##  Key Features in v1.0.0.2b

-   **Multithreaded Architecture:** The TCP communication now runs on a separate thread, preventing LCD Smartie from "freezing" or lagging during network congestion.    
-   **ESP8266 Stability Fix:** Disabled `TCP_NODELAY` to utilize Nagle’s Algorithm, which prevents overwhelming the ESP8266 CPU and reduces watchdog timer (WDT) resets.    
-   **GPO & Fan Control:** Full support for standard Matrix Orbital commands to trigger physical pins on the remote device.    
-   **Modern Build System:** Native support for **Visual Studio 2026** (x64 configuration).

## 🛠 Building the Driver

Unlike the original version which used CodeBlocks/MinGW, this version is optimized for **Visual Studio**:

1.  Open the `.sln` solution file in Visual Studio 2022.    
2.  Select your platform (**x64** is recommended for modern systems).    
3.  Set the configuration to **Release**.    
4.  Click **Build Solution**.    
5.  The final DLL will be located in the `x64\Release` or `Release` folder.

## 💻 How to Use

### 1. Installation
Copy `LCD_TCP_DLL.dll` from the build output to your `LCD_SMARTIE_ROOT\displays` folder.

### 2. Configuration
1.  Open **LCD Smartie**.    
2.  Go to **Setup** > **Display Settings**.    
3.  Select `LCD_TCP_DLL.dll` from the drop-down menu.    
4.  Enter the **IP Address** and **Port** (default 2400) shown on your LCD screen (e.g., `192.168.1.50:2400`).
